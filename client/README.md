# Oulu Bars API Client

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements for the client.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Make sure the API server is running with a working database before proceeding.
In case the server is being run on a non-local server, change the **"BASE_URL"** on the top of **main.py** -file accordingly.

After the server is up and running, simply run the client with python file **main.py**
```bash
python3 main.py
```
